# Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Extension

This is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to help developers detect vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts. **Solidity** is a high-level programming language used primarily for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By streamlining the process of identifying potential security risks, this extension makes smart contract development safer and more secure.

---

## Features

### 1. **Automatic Vulnerability Detection**

Detects common vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts, including:

- **Reentrancy Attacks**: Occurs when a contract calls an external contract and allows it to re-enter the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. This can lead to unintended behavior and potential fund loss.
  - *Example*: A malicious contract repeatedly withdraws funds before the balance is updated.

- **Integer Overflows/Underflows**: Happens when an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum or minimum value an integer can hold, causing it to wrap around.
  - *Example*: Adding `1` to the maximum value of a `uint256` causes it to reset to `0`.

- **Timestamp Dependence**: Vulnerability arises when contract logic relies on block timestamps, which miners can manipulate to some extent.
  - *Example*: Using `block.timestamp` to determine the outcome of a critical function.

### 2. **Inline Warnings and Fix Suggestions**

Highlights vulnerable code and provides actionable suggestions to mitigate issues.

### 3. **Detailed Reports**

Generates comprehensive vulnerability reports directly in the VSCode terminal or output window. The reports typically include the following information:

- **File and Line Number**: Location of the vulnerability.
- **Vulnerability Type**: The specific type of issue detected.
- **Severity Level**: Classification of the risk (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- **Description**: A brief explanation of the vulnerability.
- **Suggested Fix**: Recommendations for mitigating the issue.

### 4. **Customizable Rulesets**

Configure which vulnerabilities to detect and tailor the analysis to your project's needs.

## Installation

1. **Install via Visual Studio Code Marketplace**:
   - Search for `smart-contract-vulnerability-detection` in the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
   
2. **Manual Installation**:
   - Download the `.vsix` file from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/erfan38/plugin/releases).
   - In VSCode, run `Extensions: Install from VSIX` from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).

---

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- **`scvd.enable`**: Enable/disable the extension.
  ```json
  "scvd.enable": true
  ```

- **`scvd.customRules`**: Path to a custom ruleset file.
  ```json
  "scvd.customRules": "path/to/custom-rules.json"
  ```

- **`scvd.apiKey`**: Enter your own API key for accessing vulnerability detection services.
  ```json
  "scvd.apiKey": "your-api-key-here"
  ```

---

## Usage

1. **Analyze a Smart Contract**:
   - Open a Solidity file (`.sol`).
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) and run the command:
     ```
     SCVD: Analyze Current File
     ```

2. **Enter API Key**:
   - If the extension requires an API key, make sure to add it in your settings under `scvd.apiKey`.

3. **View Results**:
   - Results will appear in the **Output** or **Problems** panel.

## Known Issues

- **False Positives**: Some vulnerability detections may result in false positives.

Please report any issues or feature requests on the [GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/erfan38/plugin/issues).
