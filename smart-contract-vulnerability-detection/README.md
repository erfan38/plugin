# 🔧 **Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Extension**

## 📄 **Project Overview**

This Visual Studio Code extension helps developers detect vulnerabilities in **Solidity smart contracts**. Solidity is a high-level programming language primarily used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By streamlining the identification of potential security risks, this extension enhances the safety and security of smart contract development.

---

## 📊 **Features**

### 1. **Automatic Vulnerability Detection**

Detects common vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts, including:

- **🛡️ Reentrancy Attacks**: 
  - Occurs when a contract calls an external contract and allows it to re-enter before the initial execution is complete, leading to potential fund loss.
  - *Example*: A malicious contract repeatedly withdraws funds before the balance is updated.

- **📈 Integer Overflows/Underflows**: 
  - Happens when arithmetic operations exceed the maximum or minimum integer value, causing wrap-around errors.
  - *Example*: Adding `1` to the maximum value of a `uint256` resets it to `0`.

- **🕒 Timestamp Dependence**: 
  - Arises when contract logic relies on block timestamps, which miners can manipulate.
  - *Example*: Using `block.timestamp` to determine critical outcomes.

### 2. **Inline Warnings and Fix Suggestions**

Highlights vulnerable code directly in the editor and provides actionable mitigation suggestions.

### 3. **Detailed Reports**

Generates comprehensive vulnerability reports in the VSCode terminal or output window, including:

- **File and Line Number**: Where the vulnerability is located.
- **Vulnerability Type**: Type of issue detected.
- **Severity Level**: Risk classification (High, Medium, Low).
- **Description**: Explanation of the vulnerability.
- **Suggested Fix**: Recommendations for mitigation.

### 4. **Customizable Rulesets**

Configure which vulnerabilities to detect and tailor the analysis to your project's needs.

## 🗓 **Extension Settings**

This extension contributes the following settings:

- **Enable/Disable the Extension**:
  ```json
  "scvd.enable": true
  ```

- **Custom Ruleset Path**:
  ```json
  "scvd.customRules": "path/to/custom-rules.json"
  ```

## 🔧 **Usage**

1. **Analyze a Smart Contract**:
   - Open a Solidity file (`.sol`).
   - Run the command:
     ```
     SCVD: Analyze Current File
     ```

2. **Enter API Key**:
   - Add your API key in the settings under `scvd.apiKey`.

3. **Choose which vulnerability you want to check**
  - You can choose between three common vulnerabilities or you can select all of them.
  
4. **View Results**:
   - Results will appear in the **Output** or **Problems** panel.
